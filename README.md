# emojify
Mapping facial expressions to emojis using Python, Open CV and Tkinter.

Comments on the dataset:
1. The data set was of a considerable size.
2. But the images were quiet small.
3. Thus the accuracy could not be improved from a certain point.
The above statement has been made after a series of experiments that used different ConvNets to try to improvve the accuracy.

Comments on the training:
1. The dataset was trained over 50 epochs, which took a considerable amount of time to train. 
2. So consequently all the experiments were performed over a considerable amount of time.
3. This particular project used threading in Tkinter, which is a challenge in itself.
4. Three windows were multithreaded over two threads.
